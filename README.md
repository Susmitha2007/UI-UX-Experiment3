## Aim:

A single web app that combines ChatGPT’s AI assistant with Figma-like design tools — so users can chat, generate ideas, and design visually in one place without switching tabs.

## Algorithm:

1.Start the app and open both chat and design parts.

2.User gives a text or design request to the AI.

3.AI reads the request and gives some ideas or designs.

4.Show the result to the user to edit or choose.

5.If the user wants, send the design to the canvas for changes.

6.User edits, saves, or downloads the final design.

7.End.
